Problem statement
I have two scripts, one of them splits audio of a certain length,
the other one splits audio on every time there is a silent passage.
Would it be possible to split the audio on silence, but only after a certain time passed?
I would need chunks of videos split on silence which are not shorter than 5 minutes.


Splitting script with ignores silence:
chunks_t_interval.py

Splitting script which ignores length:
chunks_silance.py
